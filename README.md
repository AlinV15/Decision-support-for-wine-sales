## Decision support for wine sales

### Requirements: 
- identifying customer segments depending on the type of wine (e.g.: people of male sex prefer dryvarieties, people over 55 prefer red wines, and so on);
- identifying periods of maximum / minimum in terms of sales of wine, possibly by category;
- suggesting periods of the year when promotional campaigns should be launched;
- identifying associations when buying wines ( e.g.:the majority of people who buy Murflatar bought Bucium);
- highlighting the link between reductions / increases of price and the evolution of sales.

# And 3 are needed for complete implementation!!!
